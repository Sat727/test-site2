    <p><b>Bats</b> are mammals of the order Chiroptera.[a] With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only
        mammals capable of true and sustained flight. Bats are more agile in flight than most birds, flying with their
        very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the
        smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150
        mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the
        giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan
        of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).</p>
    <p>The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species
        worldwide, with over 1,400 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely
        fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order
        into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species
        of microbats. Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores
        (nectar-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood.
        Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these
        behaviours to escape predators. Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold
        regions. They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical
        plants depend entirely on bats for these services.</p>
